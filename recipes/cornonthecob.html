    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Corn on the cob is cooked in boiled water with a little sugar and lemon juice for the sweetest, 
        tastiest corn. My mother-in-law gave me this easy recipe. Top the cooked corn with butter and 
        a pinch of salt for the best summer side dish there is!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>6 ears corn on the cob, husks and silk removed</li>
    </ul>
      <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), and lightly grease a pizza pan.</li>
        <li>Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to make it easier.</li>
        <li> Let rest for 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a 12-inch circle.</li>
        <li>Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.</li>
        <li> Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
